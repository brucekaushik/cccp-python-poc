Gzip is a widely used lossless data compression algorithm that's particularly effective for text-based files like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other forms of code.
"Lossless" means that when you decompress a gzipped file, you get back the exact original data without any loss of information.
While newer compression algorithms like Brotli offer potentially better compression ratios, gzip remains incredibly popular due to its balance of speed, efficiency, and broad compatibility.
